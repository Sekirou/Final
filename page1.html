<h1>G14 Dataset - Religious Affiliation By Sex</h1>
<br></br>

<h2>What Is The Dataset?</h2>
<p>The G14 dataset logs the different religious affiliations in NSW based on the persons gender. It also provides data on the location of which the religious affiliations are mainly clustered around.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>Why Is The Dataset Collected?</h2>
<p>The dataset is collected in order to determine the religions present in NSW. The data is also split up into location and gender allowing for trends to be seen and can provide an idea of the current religious landscape.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>Which Government Department Would Use This Dataset And Provide Evidence?</h2>
<p>
The Government Department that would use this and provide evidence include NSW Government Education, Attorney-General’s Department, Recognised Religious Denominations, Australian National Security and Parliament of Australia. NSW Government Education has strengthened the teaching of Special Religious Education(SRE) in local schools in order to help students learn of today's modern religious beliefs. Therefore, by obtaining the data of the distribution of different religions in NSW, education boards can help schools understand what kind of information need to be taught in SRE. Attorney-General’s Department of Recognised Religious Denominations has rule and control of legally recognised ministers that can perform marriage ceremonies for the different religious organisation. This data provides evidence of legal marriages within the correct denominations for book-keeping purposes. Australian National Security and Parliament of Australia will use this data as information to understand the activities that may occur in different areas due to religious activities in order to create safety precautions for them.
</p>
<br></br>

<h2>Which Private Sector Firm Would Use This And Provide Dataset?</h2>
<p>
Building companies use this data to identify the suitable infrastructure and commercial facilities that are suitable for different suburban areas since most of the religious distributions are strongly related to the ancestry of different areas. Commercial stores will also use this data to identify the point of interest and as a guidance of the possible return on investment of that area.
</p>
<br></br>

<h2>How Does This Change Your Perception Of Space?</h2>
<p>Personal perception of space is easily manipulated when enlightened with survey data as it clearly draws a separation in space. The knowledge of the areas being clearly split up allows for zones to be created where it is generally regarded as "belonging" to a certain group. It also however, can expand the perception of space due to being able to recognise large areas of the same affiliation. These two personal views are easily exhibited when viewing larger religious affiliations that span over larger areas in comparison to smaller affiliations which cluster in smaller areas.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>How Would This Dataset Change Across Sydney?</h2>
<p>This dataset changes across Sydney dependent on the general population living in the area. The individuals in the areas across Sydney have personal lifestyles and choices of living quality. With these variables in mind, it can be seen that the obvious choice that people would move to higher quality of life areas. The feeling of "belonging" however, is based on individual personal opinion and can take many factors into account. For this particular scenario based on religious affiliation, the individual would more than likely pick areas in which their religion is more prominent as it allows them to connect with their environment more naturally.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>How Does It Relate To The Latte Line?</h2>
<p>The relationship between religious affiliation and the latte line aren't clearly defined. It can be argued that while the latte line generally separates the wealthy from the poor, the dataset however does not correspondingly show a certain religion following this type of trend. Using Sydney as a focal point in NSW, Buddhism is clustered around central Sydney. Christianity as a total is well spread out between all areas of NSW however that only stands true for the more well known denominations. Lesser known denominations and other religions tend to show a trend of clustering together in certain areas as well as usually being separated from the main cities. This shows that the latte line may have an effect on certain religions however based off pure data alone, it is difficult to confirm a definite connection between these two variables.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>How Does This Change Between 2011-2016?</h2>
<p>The major changes between 2011-2016 are that Christianity is distributed across the NSW and also has a minor decrease in growth. However, it is still the most dominant religion in NSW. Other religions do not have many apparent changes in numbers and growth in comparison. The number of non-religious people has however shown a major increase from 2011-2016.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>How Is This Data Significant To People's Lives?</h2>
<p>The data becomes significant to peoples lives when taking into consideration residential zones. When a person decides to live in an area, religious affiliation within that area may have an effect on the persons choice as they are able to achieve a quicker sense of belonging when surrounded by those of similar mindsets. 
<br></br>
This becomes significant for local government planners as it can allow for future development of facilities required by certain religions (temples, churches, synagogues, etc.). It also has an effect on creating towns and cities by subdividing the areas up into areas where religious affiliations cluster. These clustered zones will usually have trends that can explain for the type of people living in the area and hence affect the choices made when selecting an area of residency.</p>
<br></br>

<h2>Would It Be Good To Keep This Data The Same Or Change It Across Sydney. If You Wanted To Change It, How Would You Change It?</h2>
<p>The distribution of different religions into different areas is influenced by their ancestry where Buddhism is mainly near Cabramatta while Hinduism is near Campsie and Islam are distributed around the Liverpool area.
The young generation of this day and age mostly are non-religious which means it will be better for all the religions to evenly spread out across the NSW. This can result in conflict between differing religions and backgrounds to be reduced due to increasing knowledge and acceptance. Also, the wealthy inequality between different areas can be also reduced when people of different standings mix.
